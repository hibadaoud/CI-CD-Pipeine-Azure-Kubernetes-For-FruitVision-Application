## üìå **Project Overview**

This repository extends the [FruitVision-AI-Powered-Fruit-Counting-Classification-with-Docker-Containerization-and-Terraform](https://github.com/hibadaoud/FruitVision-AI-Powered-Fruit-Counting-Classification-with-Docker-Containerization-and-Terraform) project, automating and optimizing the **development** and **deployment** processes as mentionned in the future considerations. It creates a **Gitlab CI/CD pipeline** with **development**, **staging** and **production** **environments** and **tests**.

This pipeline enhances the original project by automating complex workflows, improving reliability, and reducing deployment time.  

### üå± **About the Original Project**

The original **FruitVision** project focuses on developing a deep learning computer vision model to detect, classify, and count fruits on trees. The model is integrated into a user-friendly application with a backend (NodeJs) and a persistent database (MongoDB) to track the history of predictions. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed using automated infrastructure provisioning for scalability (Terraform).

## üîë **Key Objectives**

- üõ°Ô∏è **Security and Vulnerability Scanning**: Ensure code, secrets, and container images are secure by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities during the CI/CD pipeline.  
- ‚úÖ **Automated Testing**: Automatically test all changes to ensure functionality and stability.  
- üê≥ **Dockerization**: Build, test, and package services into portable Docker images.  
- ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy services seamlessly across multiple environments (**Dev**, **Staging**, and **Production**) using Kubernetes clusters. 
- üîÑ **Integration Testing**: Validate the functionality and reliability of all services after deployment.  
- üîó **Post-Deployment Automation**: Ensure automated deployment of the application by updating the deployment URL dynamically in the Flutter app to ensure seamless deployment.
 

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture
The Gitlab CI/CD pipeline follows a **stage-by-stage process** to automate development and deployment. Below is the visual workflow:

    <img src="./images/CICD_pipeline.png" alt="CI/CD pipeline workflow">
</div>

The GitLab CI/CD pipeline automates the **integration, testing, and deployment** processes for the application, ensuring reliable and consistent delivery across different environments.

The pipeline is divided into two main phases: **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment & Delivery**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Workflow Stages**

1. **Create Feature Branch**  
   - Allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes independently, ensuring the main codebase remains stable.

2. **Continuous Integration**  
   - **Automated Build and Test**:  
     - Perform **code quality checks** and **security scans** using Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Secret Detection.  
     - Run **Unit Tests** using **Jest** to verify the backend functionality (NodeJS app) and validate the connection to MongoDB. 
     - If all tests pass:  
       - Build the **Docker image**.  
       - Test the Docker image functionality and scan for vulnerabilities.  
     - **Failure Handling**: If any step fails, the developer must fix the code and push changes again until all checks pass.  
   - **Push to DockerHub**:  
     - Store validated and tested Docker images in **DockerHub** for use in deployment.

3. **Merge to Main Branch**  
   - Merge the validated code changes into the **main branch** to prepare for deployment.

4. **Continuous Deployment & Delivery**  
   - **Dev Deployment**:  
     - Deploy the different services to the **Development Environment** for initial validation.  
     - Used for coding, testing, and debugging during development.  
     - Run **integration tests** to ensure the deployment works as expected.  
   - **Staging Deployment**:  
     - Deploy the different services to the **Staging Environment** for final testing.  
     - Perform integration tests to verify stability and functionality before production.  
   - **Production Deployment**:  
     - Deploy the different services to the **Production Environment** on the **Azure Kubernetes Cluster** with **manual approval** (click-to-deploy).  
     - Validate the live deployment with integration tests.  
   - **Remote Config Update**:  
     - Dynamically update the **deployment URL** in **Firebase Remote Config**.  
     - The Flutter application automatically fetches the updated backend and model endpoints, enabling seamless and hassle-free deployments for smooth user experiences.
