## üìå **Project Overview**

This repository extends the [FruitVision-AI-Powered-Fruit-Counting-Classification-with-Docker-Containerization-and-Terraform](https://github.com/hibadaoud/FruitVision-AI-Powered-Fruit-Counting-Classification-with-Docker-Containerization-and-Terraform) project, automating and optimizing the **development** and **deployment** processes as mentionned in the future considerations. It creates a **Gitlab CI/CD pipeline** with **development**, **staging** and **production** **environments** and **tests**.

This pipeline enhances the original project by automating complex workflows, improving reliability, and reducing deployment time.  

### üå± **About the Original Project**

The original **FruitVision** project focuses on developing a deep learning computer vision model to detect, classify, and count fruits on trees. The model is integrated into a user-friendly application with a backend (NodeJs) and a persistent database (MongoDB) to track the history of predictions. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed using automated infrastructure provisioning for scalability (Terraform).

To achieve this, test files and dependencies were added to the backend folder (`/backend/tests`) for validating functionality. Additionally, updates were made to the Flutter application code to ensure seamless deployment and integration with the deployed services.

## üîë **Key Objectives**

- üõ°Ô∏è **Security and Vulnerability Scanning**: Ensure code, secrets, and container images are secure by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities during the CI/CD pipeline.  
- ‚úÖ **Automated Testing**: Automatically test all changes to ensure functionality and stability.  
- üê≥ **Dockerization**: Build, test, and package services into portable Docker images.  
- ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy services seamlessly across multiple environments (**Dev**, **Staging**, and **Production**) using Kubernetes clusters. 
- üîÑ **Integration Testing**: Validate the functionality and reliability of all services after deployment.  
- üîó **Post-Deployment Automation**: Ensure automated deployment of the application by updating the deployment URL dynamically in the Flutter app to ensure seamless deployment.
 

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture
The Gitlab CI/CD pipeline follows a **stage-by-stage process** to automate development and deployment. Below is the visual workflow:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/CICD_pipeline.png" alt="CI/CD pipeline workflow">
</div>

The GitLab CI/CD pipeline automates the **integration, testing, and deployment** processes for the application, ensuring reliable and consistent delivery across different environments.

The pipeline is divided into two main phases: **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment & Delivery**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Workflow Stages**

1. **Create Feature Branch**  
   - Allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes independently, ensuring the main codebase remains stable.

2. **Continuous Integration**  
   - **Automated Build and Test**:  
     - Perform **code quality checks** and **security scans** using `Static Application Security Testing (SAST)` and `Secret Detection`.  
     - Run **Unit Tests** using `Jest` to verify the backend functionality (NodeJS app) and validate the connection to MongoDB. 
     - If all tests pass:  
       - Build the **Docker image**.  
       - Test the Docker image functionality and scan for vulnerabilities using `Container Scanning`.
     - **Failure Handling**: If any step fails, the developer must fix the code and push changes again until all checks pass.  
   - **Push to DockerHub**:  
     - Store validated and tested Docker images in **DockerHub** for use in deployment.

3. **Merge to Main Branch**  
   - Merge the validated code changes into the **main branch** to prepare for deployment.

4. **Continuous Deployment & Delivery**  
   - **Dev Deployment**:  
     - Deploy the different services to the **Development Environment**, on the **Azure Kubernetes Cluster**, for initial validation.  
     - Used for coding, testing, and debugging during development.  
     - Run **integration tests** to ensure the deployment works as expected.  
   - **Staging Deployment**:  
     - Deploy the different services to the **Staging Environment**, on the **Azure Kubernetes Cluster**,   for final testing.  
     - Perform **integration tests** to verify stability and functionality before production.  
   - **Production Deployment**:  
     - Deploy the different services to the **Production Environment** on the **Azure Kubernetes Cluster** with **manual approval** (click-to-deploy).  
     - Validate the live deployment with integration tests.  
   - **Remote Config Update**:  
     - Dynamically update the **deployment URL** in **Firebase Remote Config**.  
     - The Flutter application automatically fetches the updated backend and model endpoints, enabling seamless and hassle-free deployments for smooth user experiences.

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Architecture and Deployment

### Overview
The Kubernetes architecture for the FruitVision project facilitates **scalable, secure, and automated deployment** of application services across multiple environments: development, staging, and production. Using **Kubernetes Ingress**, services are exposed to external users with **load balancing** and **HTTPS encryption**.

### Goals
1. **Service Management**: Efficiently manage multiple services (backend and model) using Kubernetes resources such as:
   - **Deployments**: Ensure high availability and scalability of application pods.  
   - **Services**: Enable internal communication and expose pods to external traffic.  

2. **Dynamic Traffic Routing**: Use **Ingress** to expose services to the internet with **SSL/TLS termination** provided by **Let's Encrypt**, ensuring secure and efficient traffic handling.  
Ingress is suitable for exposing **multiple services under a single domain** or for setting up more complex routing rules.

3. **Multi-Environment Support**: Support **distinct isolated** environments using namespaces and configurable replicas for resource scaling:
   - Each environment (development, staging, and production) operates in its own **namespace**.  
   - Isolation prevents configuration conflicts and ensures dedicated resources for each stage.  
   - GitLab provides a complete history of deployments for each environment, allowing for detailed tracking and the ability to **re-deploy** or **roll back** if needed.

4. **Stability and Recovery**:
   - Rollback functionality ensures stability by enabling a return to a previous deployment in case of issues.  
   - Minimizes downtime and preserves reliability for end users.  

### Kubernetes Components
The deployment uses the following components:

1. **Deployments**:
   - Manage application pods for **backend** and **model** services based on the docker images pushed to DockerHub.
   - Ensure high availability with configurable replicas (`REPLICAS` in deploy.yaml).

2. **Services**:
   - Expose backend (`/nodejs`) and model (`/`) services internally using ClusterIP.
   - Facilitate internal communication between pods.

3. **Ingress**:
   - Use **Azure Kubernetes Ingress Controller** (`webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com`) for routing traffic to services.
   - Provide secure HTTPS access to services with **TLS certificates** from **Let's Encrypt** (`clusterIssuer.yaml`).
   - Suitable for routing requests under the URL :  
     ```
     fruitvision-${NAMESPACE}.${INGRESS_IP}.nip.io
     ```
   - This URL ensures that requests are routed appropriately based on the namespace environment `${NAMESPACE}` .
   - The **Ingress IP** is the public IP address assigned to the **Azure Kubernetes Ingress Controller**. It serves as the entry point for all external traffic directed to the Kubernetes cluster. It can be obtained by:
    ```
    INGRESS_IP=$(kubectl get service -n app-routing-system nginx -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
    ```

4. **Secrets**:
   - Store sensitive credentials (e.g., MongoDB connection details) securely using Kubernetes Secrets.

5. **Namespaces**:
   - Isolate environments to prevent configuration conflicts between development, staging, and production.

```

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Cluster and CI/CD Integration

### Cluster Creation
- The Kubernetes cluster was created using the Azure CLI command:
```bash
az aks create --resource-group fruitvision_grp --name FruitVisionCluster --tier free --generate-ssh-keys --node-vm-size Standard_B2s --node-count 2 --enable-app-routing
```
- Key Flags Explained:

  - `--generate-ssh-keys`: Automatically generates SSH keys for secure access to the Kubernetes nodes, simplifying authentication.
  - `--enable-app-routing`: Configures an ingress controller (Azure Kubernetes Ingress Controller) for traffic routing, enabling secure and efficient access to application services.

This cluster supports **development** and **production** namespaces

### Kubeconfig File
To allow interaction with the Kubernetes cluster, the kubeconfig file was retrieved using:
```
  az aks get-credentials --resource-group fruitvision_grp --name FruitVisionCluster
```
- The kubeconfig file provides cluster authentication details and is integrated into GitLab CI/CD as a variable (`DEV_KUBE_CONFIG`) to enable automated deployments to the **development** and **production** namespaces.

### Staging Environment and GitLab Agent
The staging environment is managed using the **GitLab Kubernetes Agent**, allowing secure **bidirectional communication** between GitLab and the Kubernetes cluster.
