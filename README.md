## 📌 **Project Overview**

This repository extends the [FruitVision-AI-Powered-Fruit-Counting-Classification-with-Docker-Containerization-and-Terraform](https://github.com/hibadaoud/FruitVision-AI-Powered-Fruit-Counting-Classification-with-Docker-Containerization-and-Terraform) project, automating and optimizing the **development** and **deployment** processes as mentionned in the future considerations. It creates a **Gitlab CI/CD pipeline** with **development**, **staging** and **production** **environments** and **tests**.

This pipeline enhances the original project by automating complex workflows, improving reliability, and reducing deployment time.  

### 🌱 **About the Original Project**

The original **FruitVision** project focuses on developing a deep learning computer vision model to detect, classify, and count fruits on trees. The model is integrated into a user-friendly application with a backend (NodeJs) and a persistent database (MongoDB) to track the history of predictions. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed using automated infrastructure provisioning for scalability (Terraform).

To achieve this, test files and dependencies were added to the backend folder (`/backend/tests`) for validating functionality. Additionally, updates were made to the Flutter application code to ensure seamless deployment and integration with the deployed services.

## 🔑 **Key Objectives**

- 🛡️ **Security and Vulnerability Scanning**: Ensure code, secrets, and container images are secure by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities during the CI/CD pipeline.  
- ✅ **Automated Testing**: Automatically test all changes to ensure functionality and stability.  
- 🐳 **Dockerization**: Build, test, and package services into portable Docker images.  
- ☸️ **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy services seamlessly across multiple environments (**Dev**, **Staging**, and **Production**) using Kubernetes clusters. 
- 🔄 **Integration Testing**: Validate the functionality and reliability of all services after deployment.  
- 🔗 **Post-Deployment Automation**: Ensure automated deployment of the application by updating the deployment URL dynamically in the Flutter app to ensure seamless deployment.
 

## 🏛️ Architecture
The Gitlab CI/CD pipeline follows a **stage-by-stage process** to automate development and deployment. Below is the visual workflow:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/CICD_pipeline.png" alt="CI/CD pipeline workflow">
</div>

The GitLab CI/CD pipeline automates the **integration, testing, and deployment** processes for the application, ensuring reliable and consistent delivery across different environments.

The pipeline is divided into two main phases: **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment & Delivery**.

### ⚙️ **Workflow Stages**

1. **Create Feature Branch**  
   - Allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes independently, ensuring the main codebase remains stable.

2. **Continuous Integration**  
   - **Automated Build and Test**:  
     - Perform **code quality checks** and **security scans** using `Static Application Security Testing (SAST)` and `Secret Detection`.  
     - Run **Unit Tests** using `Jest` to verify the backend functionality (NodeJS app) and validate the connection to MongoDB. 
     - If all tests pass:  
       - Build the **Docker image**.  
       - Test the Docker image functionality and scan for vulnerabilities using `Container Scanning`.
     - **Failure Handling**: If any step fails, the developer must fix the code and push changes again until all checks pass.  
   - **Push to DockerHub**:  
     - Store validated and tested Docker images in **DockerHub** for use in deployment.

3. **Merge to Main Branch**  
   - Merge the validated code changes into the **main branch** to prepare for deployment.

4. **Continuous Deployment & Delivery**  
   - **Dev Deployment**:  
     - Deploy the different services to the **Development Environment**, on the **Azure Kubernetes Cluster**, for initial validation.  
     - Used for coding, testing, and debugging during development.  
     - Run **integration tests** to ensure the deployment works as expected.  
   - **Staging Deployment**:  
     - Deploy the different services to the **Staging Environment**, on the **Azure Kubernetes Cluster**,   for final testing.  
     - Perform **integration tests** to verify stability and functionality before production.  
   - **Production Deployment**:  
     - Deploy the different services to the **Production Environment** on the **Azure Kubernetes Cluster** with **manual approval** (click-to-deploy).  
     - Validate the live deployment with integration tests.  
   - **Remote Config Update**:  
     - Dynamically update the **deployment URL** in **Firebase Remote Config**.  
     - The Flutter application automatically fetches the updated backend and model endpoints, enabling seamless and hassle-free deployments for smooth user experiences.

## ☸️ Kubernetes Architecture and Deployment

### Overview
The Kubernetes architecture for the FruitVision project facilitates **scalable, secure, and automated deployment** of application services across multiple environments: development, staging, and production. Using **Kubernetes Ingress**, services are exposed to external users with **load balancing** and **HTTPS encryption**.

### Goals
1. **Service Management**: Efficiently manage multiple services (backend and model) using Kubernetes resources such as:
   - **Deployments**: Ensure high availability and scalability of application pods.  
   - **Services**: Enable internal communication and expose pods to external traffic.  

2. **Dynamic Traffic Routing**: Use **Ingress** to expose services to the internet with **SSL/TLS termination** provided by **Let's Encrypt**, ensuring secure and efficient traffic handling.  
Ingress is suitable for exposing **multiple services under a single domain** or for setting up more complex routing rules.

3. **Multi-Environment Support**: Support **distinct isolated** environments using namespaces and configurable replicas for resource scaling:
   - Each environment (development, staging, and production) operates in its own **namespace**.  
   - Isolation prevents configuration conflicts and ensures dedicated resources for each stage.  
   - GitLab provides a complete history of deployments for each environment, allowing for detailed tracking and the ability to **re-deploy** or **roll back** if needed.

4. **Stability and Recovery**:
   - Rollback functionality ensures stability by enabling a return to a previous deployment in case of issues.  
   - Minimizes downtime and preserves reliability for end users.  

### Kubernetes Components
The deployment uses the following components:

1. **Deployments**:
   - Manage application pods for **backend** and **model** services based on the docker images pushed to DockerHub.
   - Ensure high availability with configurable replicas (`REPLICAS` in deploy.yaml).

2. **Services**:
   - Expose backend (`/nodejs`) and model (`/`) services internally using ClusterIP.
   - Facilitate internal communication between pods.

3. **Ingress**:
   - Use **Azure Kubernetes Ingress Controller** (`webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com`) for routing traffic to services.
   - Provide secure HTTPS access to services with **TLS certificates** from **Let's Encrypt** (`clusterIssuer.yaml`).
   - Suitable for routing requests under the URL :  
     ```
     fruitvision-${NAMESPACE}.${INGRESS_IP}.nip.io
     ```
   - This URL ensures that requests are routed appropriately based on the namespace environment `${NAMESPACE}` .
   - The **Ingress IP** is the public IP address assigned to the **Azure Kubernetes Ingress Controller**. It serves as the entry point for all external traffic directed to the Kubernetes cluster. It can be obtained by:
    ```
    INGRESS_IP=$(kubectl get service -n app-routing-system nginx -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
    ```

4. **Secrets**:
   - Store sensitive credentials (e.g., MongoDB connection details) securely using Kubernetes Secrets.

5. **Namespaces**:
   - Isolate environments to prevent configuration conflicts between development, staging, and production.

```

### Kubernetes Cluster and CI/CD Integration

#### Cluster Creation
- The Kubernetes cluster was created using the Azure CLI command:
```bash
az aks create --resource-group fruitvision_grp --name FruitVisionCluster --tier free --generate-ssh-keys --node-vm-size Standard_B2s --node-count 2 --enable-app-routing
```
- Key Flags Explained:

  - `--generate-ssh-keys`: Automatically generates SSH keys for secure access to the Kubernetes nodes, simplifying authentication.
  - `--enable-app-routing`: Configures an ingress controller (Azure Kubernetes Ingress Controller) for traffic routing, enabling secure and efficient access to application services.

This cluster supports **development** and **production** namespaces

#### Kubeconfig File
To allow interaction with the Kubernetes cluster, the kubeconfig file was retrieved using:
```
  az aks get-credentials --resource-group fruitvision_grp --name FruitVisionCluster
```
- The kubeconfig file provides cluster authentication details and is integrated into GitLab CI/CD as a variable (`DEV_KUBE_CONFIG`) to enable automated deployments to the **development** and **production** namespaces.

#### GitLab Agent Integration
For the **staging deployment**, the **GitLab Kubernetes Agent** was used. 
- It enables secure communication between GitLab and Kubernetes clusters. 
- It eliminates the need to expose the Kubernetes API or store sensitive credentials in third-party systems. This integration ensures robust security and streamlined operations.

- The agent operates in a **client-server configuration**:
  - **agentk**: The cluster-side component installed in the Kubernetes cluster.
  - **KAS (GitLab Agent Server)**: The GitLab-side component that manages communication with the agent.

## 🌐 Firebase Remote Config Integration

- Firebase Remote Config **dynamically updates configuration parameters**, such as deployment URLs (e.g., **model API** and **history API**), without requiring manual changes. This eliminates the need for hardcoded URLs in the Flutter application and ensures **real-time synchronization** between **deployed services** and the **flutter application**. 

- Integrated with GitLab CI/CD, Firebase Remote Config automates updates **after each successful production deployment**, reducing manual intervention and enhancing **scalability**, **reliability**, and **seamless app deployment**.

### 🚀 **Usage in GitLab CI/CD**

In the GitLab CI/CD pipeline, Firebase Remote Config is used to update the **MODEL_API** and **HISTORY_API** keys after deploying the backend and model services.

#### **GitLab CI/CD Configuration**
```yaml
update_firebase_config:
    stage: post-deploy
    needs:
      - k8s_prod_fastapi_integration_testing
      - k8s_prod_backend_integration_testing
    before_script:
      # Install required dependencies
      - apt-get update -qq 
      - apt-get install -y gettext curl jq
      - envsubst --version

      # Install Google Cloud SDK
      - curl -sSL https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
      - export PATH="$PATH:/root/google-cloud-sdk/bin"
    script:
     # Authenticate with Google Cloud using the Service Account
      - gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=serviceAccountKey.json --quiet

      # Get OAuth 2.0 Access Token
      - export ACCESS_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.remoteconfig)
      - echo "Access Token obtained successfully."

      # Generate Remote Config JSON file
      - envsubst < remote-config.template.json > remote-config.json
      - echo "Generated Remote Config JSON:"
      - cat remote-config.json

      # Deploy Remote Config using Firebase REST API
      - |
        curl -X PUT \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json; UTF-8" \
            -H "If-Match: *" \
            -d @remote-config.json \
            "https://firebaseremoteconfig.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID/remoteConfig"

      - echo "Firebase Remote Config updated successfully with new values."
    environment:
      name: production
```
1. **Authentication**:
   - Activates a Google Cloud Service Account (`serviceAccountKey.json`) and retrieves an OAuth 2.0 Access Token.
2. **Configuration Generation**:
   - Generates a `remote-config.json` file by replacing placeholders in the `remote-config.template.json` with the deployed URLs.
   ```
   {
    "parameters": {
      "HISTORY_API": {
        "defaultValue": { "value": "https://${INGRESS_URL}/nodejs" }
      },
      "MODEL_API": {
        "defaultValue": { "value": "https://${INGRESS_URL}" }
      }
    }
   }
   ```
3. **Firebase Update**:
   - Sends the updated configuration to Firebase using the Firebase REST API to reflect new endpoint URLs.
4. **Dependencies**:
   - Runs after successful integration testing (`k8s_prod_fastapi_integration_testing` and `k8s_prod_backend_integration_testing`).
### 📱 **Integration in Flutter Application**

In the Flutter application, Firebase Remote Config is initialized and used to dynamically load the API URLs for the backend services.

#### **Initialization in `main.dart`**
```dart
import 'package:firebase_remote_config/firebase_remote_config.dart';

class ApiConfig {
  static String historyApi = "";
  static String modelApi = "";

  static Future<void> fetchRemoteConfig() async {
    final remoteConfig = FirebaseRemoteConfig.instance;

    try {
      print('Fetching Remote Config...');
      bool updated = await remoteConfig.fetchAndActivate();
      print('Remote Config updated: $updated');

      // Retrieve parameters
      historyApi = remoteConfig.getString('HISTORY_API');
      modelApi = remoteConfig.getString('MODEL_API');

      // Debug logs to confirm values
      print('HISTORY_API: $historyApi');
      print('MODEL_API: $modelApi');

    } catch (e) {
      print('Error fetching Remote Config: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

- **Steps**:
  1. **Initialize Firebase Remote Config** in the `main` function.
  2. **Fetch and Activate** the latest configurations.
  3. Store the **MODEL_API** and **HISTORY_API** in static variables for global access.

#### **Usage in Camera Widget**
The `Camera` widget utilizes the `ApiConfig` class to send images for analysis to the model API.
```dart
final uri = Uri.parse(ApiConfig.modelApi + '/analyze/');
final request = http.MultipartRequest('POST', uri);
request.files.add(await http.MultipartFile.fromPath('file', imageFile.path));
```

## 🔮 Future Considerations

1. **Optimization of Deployed Services**:  
   Future iterations of the project could focus on optimizing the deployed services to improve performance and resource efficiency. This includes:
   - Fine-tuning Kubernetes resource allocation (e.g., CPU and memory limits) to match the workload requirements while minimizing costs.
   - Implementing autoscaling policies for pods based on real-time traffic patterns and load metrics.
   - Enhancing the monitoring setup with tools like Prometheus and Grafana to gain deeper insights into application performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure reliability under varying conditions.

2. **Canary Deployment for Progressive Rollouts**:  
   Implementing a canary deployment strategy would allow rolling out updates to a subset of users before fully deploying to all users. This approach reduces risks associated with deploying new versions by:
   - Gradually splitting traffic between the existing and new versions, ensuring stable functionality.
   - Using user feedback and monitoring metrics (e.g., error rates, latency) to validate the new version's performance.
   - Automating rollback mechanisms to revert to the previous version if any issues are detected during the canary rollout.

3. **Integration of Continuous Security Practices**:  
   Security enhancements can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure robust protection of the application and user data:
   - Adding runtime security checks to detect anomalies in deployed services.
   - Utilizing Kubernetes features like Pod Security Policies and Network Policies to limit attack surfaces and enforce security best practices.
